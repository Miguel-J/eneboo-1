Major:
- server-initiated updates are still not entirely reliable: may cause
  memory leaks in browsers, and are sensitive to proxy servers closing
  inactive connections...

Minor:
- key handling in SuggestionPopup.C behaves differently in different browsers
- getAttribute() in SuggestionPopup.C gets literal character entitites in Opera
- Adding widgets to a container with a layout manager (something that you
  should not do according to the documentation) and subsequently removing
  them causes javascript errors.
