<h1>Wt Release notes</h1>

This file lists important notes on migrating existing applications to
newer version of Wt. It lists changes in the library that may break
the way you build Wt, the way you configure Wt or the Wt API and
behaviour.

<h2>Release 2.2.4 (April 24, 2009)</h2>

<p>This release is a maintenance release, with only bug fixes.</p>

<h2>Release 2.2.3 (Jan 26, 2009)</h2>

<p>This release is a maintenance release, with mostly bug fixes and
feature improvements.</p>

</dl>

<h3>C) Changes that break backward compatibility</h3>

<p>This release does not contain changes that break existing
applications.</p>

<h2>Release 2.2.1 (Nov 3, 2008)</h2>

<p>This release is as usually a mix of bug fixes, improvements and new
features.</p>

<p>We have made a significant change to the MVC system, which will
break existing program code in case you have implemented your own
models (i.e. deriving from <samp>WAbstractItemModel</samp>) or views
widgets (i.e. components that listen to model changes).</p>

<p>
The <samp>WAbstractItemModel</samp> interface was changed to support
hierarchical models. This means that most methods will now take an
extra parameter that specifies the parent <samp>WModelIndex</samp>,
and also all signals have now this extra parameter. Because the
parameter has a default value of WModelIndex() which corresponds to
the top level parent, the API is largely backwards compatible when
merely using the model. It is only those classes that reimplement the
interface, or listen to signal events, that are affected.
</p>

<p>
The immediate benefit of the new <samp>WAbstracItemModel</samp>
interface is that it allows us to implement View widgets like the new
<samp>WTreeView</samp> widget.
</p>

<h2>Release 2.2.0 (Sept 12, 2008)</h2>

<p>This release has a rather substantial rewrite (and simplification)
of Wt's bootstrapping process. In the past, Wt used a frameset trick
to be able to load the AJAX-based skeleton when JavaScript was
available. Isntead, now, the entire AJAX-based stuff is loaded
directly into the bootstrap page. A benefit of the new approach is
that we avoid iframe tricks, which have been deprecated from strict
HTML and XHTML. But, it was in fact motivated in the first place to
support all major browsers for a new internal path API. This new API
allows to fully support URL changes and bookmarks in a unified way
(i.e. it works equally when the browser supports AJAX, no JavaScript,
or is a bot such as google bot).</p>

<p>As a consequence, this release contains the following changes that
may break your application:</p>

<ul>
  <li><samp>WMenu::enableBrowserHistory()</samp> and <samp>WMenu::browserHistoryId()</samp> have been removed, use the new methods <samp>WMenu::setInternalPathEnabled()</samp> and <samp>WMenu::setInternalBasePath()</samp>
  </li>
  <li><samp>WMenuItem</samp> has been reorganized, and if you have
  specialized WMenuItem you will need to adapt your reimplementation
  to the new virtual interface. In the new interface, you need to
  reimplement <samp>WMenuItem::createItemWidget()</samp> and
  <samp>WMenuItem::updateItemWidget()</samp> allowing you to react to
  item changes (internal path or text). The default implementation now
  always uses a WAnchor.</li>
  <li><samp>WApplication::setState()</samp>, <samp>WApplication::state()</samp> and <samp>WApplication::stateChanged</samp> have been deprecated. It is stronly advised that you use the new internal path API instead. This does require you to treat different parts of the state as a file hierarchy. See the <samp>WApplication::setInternalPath() documentation</samp>.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  The following methods have been deprecated (but are still supported):
<ul>
  <li><samp>WTable::numRows()</samp> has been renamed
  to <samp>WTable::rowCount()</samp>.</li>
  <li><samp>WTable::numColumns()</samp> has been renamed
  to <samp>WTable::columnCount()</samp>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Release 2.1.5 (July 25, 2008)</h2>

<p>Wt now installs its include files in a Wt/ subdirectory. You may
want to change your build files to pick up this new include directory,
or, change your code to scope the include files to look like
#include&lt;Wt/WLineEdit&gt; instead of #include&lt;WLineEdit&gt;</p>

<p>This release contains the following changes that may break your
application:</p>

<ul>
  <li><samp>WText</samp> will validate XHTML text when it is set to the
   widget. The old behaviour was to validate only before
   rendering. The change was needed to be able to react to XML parse
   errors. As a consequence if you are creating a WText with text that
   is not valid XML, followed by a
   call <samp>setFormatting(WText::PlainFormatting)</samp>, you should
   change this now to use the new <samp>WText</samp> constructor which
   takes the TextFormat as a new argument: <samp>new WText(text,
   Wt::PlainText, parentWidget)</samp>
  </li>
  <li><samp>WContainerWidget::setLayout(WLayout *layout, bool fitWidth, bool
   fitHeight)</samp> has been replaced with the more generic
   <samp>WContainerWidget::setLayout(WLayout *layout, int
   alignment)</samp>.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  The following methods and enumerations have been deprecated (but are
  still supported):
<ul>
  <li><samp>enum WText::Formatting</samp> has been renamed
  to <samp>Wt::TextFormat</samp>. The old values map as follows on new
  values:
    <ul>
      <li><samp>WText::XHTMLFormatting</samp> becomes <samp>Wt::XHTMLText</samp>;</li>
      <li><samp>WText::XHTMLUnsafeFormatting</samp> becomes <samp>Wt::XHTMLUnsafeText</samp></li>
      <li><samp>WText::PlainFormatting</samp> becomes <samp>Wt::PlainText</samp></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><samp>WText::setFormatting()</samp> has been renamed
  to <samp>WText::setTextFormat()</samp> and
  WText::formatting()</samp> has been renamed
  to <samp>WText::textFormat()</samp>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Release 2.1.4 (July 4, 2008)</h2>

<p>The following has changed for building Wt:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The CMake variable CONFIGURATION (which defaulted to
  /etc/wt/wt_config.xml) is no longer used, but instead there is now a
  CONFIGDIR (/etc/wt/) which is used to store configuration
  files.
  </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>The following has changed in the wt_config.xml file:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The &lt;valgrind-path&gt; setting for the FCGI connector may now
    be a command-line including arguments</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>This release should not contain changes that may break your
application.</p>

<h2>Release 2.1.3 (May 20, 2008)</h2>

<p>This release should not contain changes that may break your
application.</p>

<h2>Release 2.1.2 (April 14, 2008)</h2>

<p>The following changes may break your application build:</p>

<ul>
  <li><samp>WTreeNode::expanded()</samp> has been renamed
  to <samp>WTreeNode::isExpanded()</samp>.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Release 2.1.1 (April 10, 2008)</h2>

<p>This release should not break any of your applications, but we did
 deprecate some methods and enumeration types. You are advised to
 migrate to the replacements methods since we will discontinue support
 for the older ones in the future.</p>

<p>
  The following methods and enumerations have been deprecated:
<ul>
  <li><samp>enum SelectionUnit</samp> has been renamed
  to <samp>SelectionBehavior</samp>. The old values map as follows on new
  values: <samp>CellSelection</samp> becomes <samp>SelectItems</samp>;
    <samp>RowSelection</samp> becomes <samp>SelectRows</samp>.</li>
  <li><samp>WWidget::setOffset(int sides, WLength)</samp> is deprecated,
  and the new method is <samp>WWidget::setOffsets(WLength, int
  sides)</samp>: the argument order has been switched to be consistent
  with the method signature of <samp>setMargin()</samp>
  and <samp>setPadding()</samp>.</li>
  <li><samp>WResource::suggestFilename()</samp> has been renamed to
  <samp>WResource::suggestFileName()</samp>.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
  The following changes affect run-time behaviour:
<ul>
  <li><samp>WTreeNode</samp> now supports a policy for when to show a child count
  indication. The old behaviour was to always show the child count.
  Now, by default this option is disabled. Use
  <samp>WTreeNode::setChildCountPolicy(Enabled)</samp> to get the old
  behaviour back, if you wish.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Release 2.1.0</h2>

<p>The library dependencies have changed slightly.</p>

<p>
To build Wt 2.1.0, you need:
<ul>
  <li>CMake 2.4 or later</li>
  <li>boost 1.34.1 (boost 1.33.1 might should still work, but is
    not recommended)</li>
  <li>asio 0.3.9: either the boost or non-boost version <i>(only
      for the http connector)</i></li>
  <li><i>optionally</i>, openssl for HTTPS support <i>(only for the http
      connector)</i></li>
  <li><i>optionally</i>, libz for gzip compression support <i>(only for
      the http connector)</i></li>
  <li>fcgi library, including C++ bindings (libfcgi++)<i>(only for the
      fcgi connector)</i></li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Wt::Ext library has been upgraded and now wraps
around the extjs 2.x library, instead of extjs 1.x.</p>

<p>Some API changes may need a porting effort:
  <ul>
    <li><samp>Ext::ProgressDialog</samp>: doesn't show by default, you
    need to call show() to show the dialog.</li>
    <li><samp>Ext::ContentPanel</samp>, <samp>Ext::BorderLayout</samp> have
    been removed. They have been replaced with a stand-alone layout
    system, that may manage contents in
    an <samp>Ext::Container</samp>. The layout system provides
    <samp>WBorderLayout</samp> and several other layout managers.</li>
    <li><samp>WSignalMapper</samp> has been expanded to allow mapping of
      signals with an extra argument, which is passed to the mapped
      signal. Because of this, the signature of the class has been
      expanded with an extra template argument. If you have forward
      declarations to <samp>WSignalMapper</samp>, you will need to modify
      these too (or simply include <samp>WSignalMapper</samp>).<li>
    <li><samp>WAnchor</samp>: no longer uses a <samp>WLabel</samp> internally,
      and the label-releated methods have been removed.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h2>Release 2.0.5</h2>

<ul>
  <li><samp>WDialog</samp> (and <samp>WMessageBox</samp>) usage changed, and
    is now more like Qt. When you are not
    using <samp>WDialog::exec()</samp> or <samp>WMessageBox::show(...)</samp>,
    then you must explictly <samp>show()</samp> the dialog to show it. You
    can now also <samp>hide()</samp> the dialog if you want.
  </li>
  <li>
    Moved several enums from within classes to the Wt namespace. This is
    likely to break your code at compile time when you are using one. The
    fix is to remove the class scope from the enum type or value.
    <ul>
      <li><samp>WScrollArea::Orientation</samp> -> <samp>Wt::Orientation</samp></li>
      <li><samp>WMenu::Orientation</samp> -> <samp>Wt::Orientation</samp></li>
      <li><samp>WMessageBox::StandardButton</samp> -> <samp>Wt::StandardButton</samp></li>
      <li><samp>WMessageBox::Icon</samp> -> <samp>Wt::Icon</samp></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Release 2.0.4</h2>

<i>Important: 2.0.4a contains a fix for a bug introduced in 2.0.4 that
  reset the deploy-path in wthttpd.</i>

<p>
  This release adds a few new features:
  
  <ul>
    <li><samp>WComboBox</samp> (and <samp>WSelectionBox</samp>) now use
      a <samp>WAbstractItemModel</samp> in a more flexible model/view
      system.</li>
    <li>Stylesheets may be browser-conditional (by Patrick Fischer)</li>
    <li>wthttpd may serve custom error pages (by Patrick Fischer)</li>
    <li><samp>WResource</samp> can now access HTTP GET or POST query
      arguments. This will break your code (at compile time) if you
      have implemented your own <samp>WResource</samp>, since the signature of the
      <samp>streamResourceData()</samp> method has been changed to pass
      the arguments map as a second parameter.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h2>Release 2.0.1</h2>

<p>
  This release fixes some build-related problems, as well as smaller
  bugs. The main improvement in this release is related to use of Wt
  in resource-constrained embedded systems.
</p>

<p>
  The most visible change is that the dependency on the Xerces C++ XML
  library was dropped in favour of the much smaller Mini-XML
  library. The draw-back is a reduction of supported character
  encodings to only UTF8 and UTF16, next to the default locale character
  encoding (which is typically an 8-bit flavour).
</p>

<p>
  When using the built-in httpd, you can now disable support for SSL
  at compile time, freeing a number of SSL-related dependencies.
</p>

<p>
  In the API, more comparison operators (== and !=) were added to
  WString, and a WViewWidget was added for simple MVC widgets (with
  the main purpose to reduce session-state at the server).
</p>

<h2>Release 2.0.0</h2>

<p>
  This release contains numerous changes which are likely to cause some
  porting effort for Wt 1.1.x applications to work properly.
</p>

<p>
<emph>If you are upgrading from a 1.99.x release, you will notice that
some of these notes have actually evolved, especially with respect to
WString and unicode support.</emp>
</p>

<p>
  Here is a list of changes with respect to Wt 1.1.x that are likely
  to require your attention, and some tips on how to do the porting.
</p>

<h4>1) Namespace Wt</h4>

<p>All Wt classes are now inside the namespace <samp>Wt</samp>.</p>

<p>To handle this change, you will need to:
  <ul>
    <li>Wrap forward declarations to Wt widgets in header files inside a
      Wt namespace, or <samp>#include &lt;WFwdDeclarations&gt;</samp></li>
    <li>and scope all Wt classes with <samp>Wt::</samp>, </li>
    <li>or import the Wt namespace: <samp>using namespace Wt;</samp></li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h4>2) WString</h4>

<p>
  Previously, most widgets offered double methods that either used a
  <samp>std::string</samp> for literal text, or a
  <samp>WMessage</samp> for localized text.
</p>

<p>
  In the new release, widgets use <samp>Wt::WString</samp> for both
  literal and localized text. WString offers unicode support for both
  literal as well as localized text. To create a literal string,
  simply assign or construct a Wt::WString from that string. The
  strings supported or both narrow and wide C and C++ strings. UTF8
  encoded narrow strings may also be converted. To create a localized
  string, use one of the static methods <samp>WString::tr(const
  std::string key)</samp> and <samp>WWidget::tr(const std::string
  key)</samp>.
</p>

<p>
  To help with legacy code, WMessage is now a typedef for WString, but
  is deprecated and should not be used in new code. Unfortunately, the
  constructors <samp>WMessage(const char *text)</samp> and
  <samp>WMessage(const std::string text)</samp>, changed meaning!
  While previously they took a key to construct a localized message,
  they now take a literal text (the exact opposite!), since they are
  in fact plain WString() constructors. As a consequence your application
  will display key values instead of resolving those values (but will
  not break entirely).
</p>
<p>
  The new approach offers the benefit of only requiring one method
  signature for both literal and localizable text. This not only
  simplifies our work, but more importantly by using
  <samp>WString</samp> for displayed text in the API of your own
  widgets, localization (including the automatic language switching)
  comes automatically and is decided on by the user of your widget.
</p>
<p>
  Fortunately, there is a straightforward trick to handle most consequences
  of this change:
  <ul>
   <li>Replace <samp>WMessage(...)</samp> with <samp>tr(...)</samp>,</li>
   <li>add <samp>.value()</samp> when using the result of functions such
     as <samp>WText::text()</samp>,
   <li>change your own classes to use <samp>WString</samp>
     wherever they expect some text that will be displayed, instead of
     std::string or WMessage.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h4>3) Wide string API</h4>

<p>
  Since Wt 2.0.0, the API for Wt has been changed to use WString
  instead of C++ narrow strings. WString supports both narrow and wide
  strings, and provides conversion between both. It does not provide
  string operations, however, and instead acts as a string
  container. You should convert to a C++ string type to perform
  operations. You should also not use WString outside of the user
  interface part of your application.
</p>

<h4>4) No more wmain()</h4>

<p>
  Previously, the Wt library implemented the <samp>main(int argc, char
  **argv)</samp> function, and called a <samp>wmain()</samp> function
  which created the WApplication instance.
</p>
<p>
  Wt 2.0.0 allows multiple applications to run within a single process.
  Therefore, the <samp>WApplication::exec()</samp> approach was no longer
  feasible. The new approach requires that:

  <ul>
    <li>your main function should look like this:
<pre>
int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  return Wt::WRun(argc, argv, &amp;createApplication);
}
</pre>
    </li>
    <li>where createApplication is a function of the following
      signature:

<pre>
Wt::WApplication *createApplication(const Wt::WEnvironment& env)
{
  // return a new application object.
}
</pre>

    </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h4>5) Configuration in /etc/wt/wt_config.xml</h4>

<p>
  Wt 2.0.0 uses a configuration file for a number of settings that 
  could previously be configured at build time of the library, or
  in the API. The latter functions are:

<ul>
  <li><samp>WApplication::setMaximumRquestSize()</samp></li>
  <li><samp>WApplication::setIdleTimeout()</samp></li>  
</ul>

</p>

<h4>6) Removed obsolete classes</h4>

<p>
  Wt 2.0.0 removed a number of classes that were still in the widget
  tree, but have been obsoleted by more flexible classes:

<ul>
  <li><samp>WAbstractTab</samp>, <samp>WButtonTab</samp>, and <samp>WTabWidget</samp> are obsoleted by the more flexible <samp>WMenu</samp>.</li>
</ul>

</p>

<h4>7) Deprecate boost::regex from WRegExpValidator API</h4>

<p>
  The constructor and methods that takes a boost::regex object in
  the WRegExpValidator API have been deprecated, to remove the dependency
  on boost from the public API. You should consider the std::string based
  construtor and method instead.
</p>

<h4>8) WObject::emit() has been removed.</h4>

<p>
  Since Wt 1.99.1, we have removed WObject::emit() function. Instead,
  you may simply call the signal with its arguments, or use the
  explicit emit method (recommended).</p>

<p>
  To adapt your code, you should: 
  <ul>
    <li>Replace all <samp>emit(MySignal(...))</samp> with <samp>MySignal(...)</samp> or <samp>MySignal.emit(...)</samp>
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>


<h4>9) WResource::streamResourceData() signature has changed.</h4>

<p>
  Since Wt 2.0.0, WResource::streamResourceData() returns a boolean value
  which indicates if all data has been streamed. If you have reimplemented
  WResource for your applications, you must update the signature and return
  true.
</p>
<p>
  The change is relevant only within the new server-push support that is
  now in Wt 2.0.0. This allows you to continuously append to the content
  of a resource.
</p>

<h4>10) Rename of WJavascriptSlot to JSlot.</h4>

<h2>Release 1.1.7</h2>

This release contains lots of additions and improvements, but should
be completely backwards-compatible.

<h2>Release 1.1.6</h2>

There is one change which will impact the behaviour of current applications:
Currently, on exit, by default the last widget updates are shown. So, no
more good-bye message. This changes slightly when one needs to redirect()
to a new location: not when WApplication::exec() returns, but during the
same event handling as when calling WApplication::quit().

<h2>Release 1.1.5</h2>

Nothing special...

<h2>Release 1.1.4</h2>

Changes to impact everybody, since the previous release:

<ul>
<li>
  The dependency for libxml++ (and its large number of dependencies) has
  been dropped, and replaced by Xerces-C++ (which has no further dependencies).
</li>
<li>
  Wt programs need to link against libwtfcgi.so, instead of libwt.so. In the
  future Wt will also support different web-connnector systems besides
  FastCGI.
</li>
<li>
  The signatures of wmain() and WApplication constructor have changed:
  new signatures are:
  <ul>
    <li>int wmain(const WEnvironment& env)</li>
    <li>WApplication::WApplication(const WEnvironment& env)</li>
 </ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Other changes:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Support for unicode is implemented, but perhaps needs more testing
  by non-Western people ? Only UTF-8 is supported currently.</li>
  <li>Addition of a WTimer class -- see mission example.</li>
  <li>Many bug fixes which should make Wt more robust against illegal CGI
    requests (which are ignored), and now Wt should exit cleanly in more
    (all?) circumstances.</li>
  <li>Addition of feed-back for pending AJAX requests (does not work yet on
    IE).</li>
  <li>Support for style sheets is improved: now inline decoration styles
    will override style sheet styles. See hangman or treelist examples.</li>
  <li>The browser can be redirected to a new page. This is useful when the
    application is terminated -- or to change during the application from
    HTTP to HTTPS and back.</li>
  <li>WValidationStatus API has changed -- less complicated now.</li>
</ul>
