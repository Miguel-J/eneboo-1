/*! \class WTreeNode Wt/WTreeNode Wt/WTreeNode
 *  \brief A single node in a tree.
 *
 * A tree list is constructed by combining several tree node objects
 * in a tree hierarchy, by passing the parent tree node as the last
 * argument in the child node constructor, or by using addChildNode(),
 * to add a child to its parent.
 *
 * Each tree node has a label, and optionally a label icon pair. The
 * icon pair offers the capability to show a different icon depending
 * on the state of the node (expanded or collapsed). When the node has
 * any children, a child count may be displayed next to the label
 * using setChildCountPolicy().
 *
 * Expanding a tree node it will collapse all its children, so that a user
 * may collapse/expand a node as a short-cut to collapsing all children.
 *
 * The treenode provides several policies to communicate the current
 * contents of the tree to the client (if possible):
 * <ul>
 *   <li>WTreeNode::PreLoading: the entire tree is transmitted to the client,
 *     and all tree navigation requires no further communication.</li>
 *   <li>WTreeNode::LazyLoading: only the minimum is transmitted to the
 *     client. When expanding a node for the first time, only then it is
 *     transmitted to the client, and this may thus have some latency.</li>
 *   <li>WTreeNode::NextLevelLoading: all leafs of visible children are
 *     transmitted, but not their children. This provides a good trade-off
 *     between bandwith use and interactivity, since expanding any
 *     tree node will happen instantly, and at the same time trigger some
 *     communication in the back-ground to load the next level of
 *     invisible nodes.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * The default policy is WTreeNode::LazyLoading. Another load policy
 * may be specified using setLoadPolicy() on the root node and before
 * adding any children. The load policy is inherited by all children
 * in the tree.
 *
 * There are a few scenarios where it makes sense to specialize the
 * %WTreeNode class. One scenario is create a tree that is populated
 * dynamically while browsing. For this purpose you should reimplement the
 * populate() method, whose default implementation does nothing. This
 * method is called when 'loading' the node. The exact moment for loading
 * a treenode depends on the LoadPolicy.
 *
 * A second scenario that is if you want to customize the look of the
 * tree label (see labelArea()) or if you want to modify or augment
 * the event collapse/expand event handling (see doExpand() and
 * doCollapse()).
 *
 * Next to the icons, two style classes determine the look of a
 * %WTreeNode: the label has CSS style class "treenodelabel", and the
 * child count has CSS style class "treenodechildcount".
 *
 * For example, the following CSS stylesheet styles a tree for which the
 * root has style class "mytree":
 *
 * \code
mytree * .treenodelabel {
  font-size: smaller;
}
mytree * .treenodechildcount {
  font-size: smaller;
  color: blue;
}
 * \endcode
 *
 * The tree node uses an image-pack, which is a collection of images
 * to render the expand/collapse icons and lines. Use setImagePack()
 * to specify the location of these icons -- a suitable set of images
 * are distributed in Wt's <tt>resources/</tt> folder. This needs only
 * be done on the root of the tree, as child nodes will query their
 * ancestors for the location of these images, when they are not set
 * explicitly:
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>nav-plus-line-middle.gif</b>: expand icon for all but the last
 *     child in a node.</li>
 *   <li><b>nav-minus-line-middle.gif</b>: collapse icon for all but the last
 *     child in a node.</li>
 *   <li><b>line-middle.gif</b>: like nav-plus-line-middle.gif but for nodes
 *     that cannot be expanded as they have no children.</li>
 *   <li><b>nav-plus-line-last.gif</b>: same as nav-plus-line-middle.gif but
 *     for the last node (terminates the vertical line).</li>
 *   <li><b>nav-minus-line-last.gif</b>: same as nav-minus-line-middle.gif but
 *     for the last node (terminates the vertical line).</li>
 *   <li><b>line-last.gif</b>: same as line-middle.gif but for the last node
 *     (terminates the vertical line).</li>
 *   <li><b>line-trunk.gif</b>: extension gif for the vertical line.
 *     </li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * See WTree for a usage example.
